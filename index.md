### CPSC 120

* Lab 10 
    Part 3 is my favorite of all. It is my first time encountering C++ programming using Magick++. The color was finally been added to the code, it makes the project we’re doing no longer in “black and white” letters. It’s a whole new thing to me, to create images on the computer. We have to create everything, every bit of color by ourselves. Unlike using drawing software, random colors in the image can be created by myself and can be uploaded to my web page. It was amazing! I understood how difficult it is to print colors. 
* Lab 3
    I made a friend (my partner). When we did a program in this lab, I found she is a nice person. We talked a lot. Hopefully, I’ll meet her next semester again. Anyway, Lab 3 is my second favorite! It was my first time writing an if-else statement. The logic is interesting. It seems to be difficult at first. But, after communicating with my partner, we drew a graph to clarify the pattern. We successfully did the program in Lab 3! I like the interaction between the programmer and the user. I like every program that requires the user to input value. It’s like communicating with the computer. It feels like I’m no longer talking to a machine, instead, to a live creature. A friendly one.
* Lab 8
    Part 1 is my favorite, too. Perhaps not that much, since it took me a long time to figure it out. It was majorly about reading the .txt files and inputting the text inside, to see if the word is a palindrome or not. Reading a text file in a program could be a useful technique in the future. Searching for certain keywords inside my txt file is also important. If searching words are available, why not search for certain sentences? It could be useful for writing or finding a quote is our writings.
