### CPSC 120

#### Lab 10 
    Part-3 is my favorite of all. It is out first time to encounter using Magick++. COLORS has finally been added into our code, it makes the project we're doing no longer in "black and white", in letters. It's a whole new thing to me, to create images on  computer. We have to create everything, every bit of color by ourselves, unlike using a drawing sofrware, randomly colors our pages and upload the image. It was amazing, I understood how difficult it was to print colors. 
* Lab 3
    I made a friend (my partner) when doing this lab, she is a nice person. We talked a lot, hopefullly I'll meet her next semester. 
    Anyway Part-3 is my favorite! It was my first time to write an if-else statement. The logic is interesting, seems to be difficult at first, but after communicating with my partner (she is a really nice person) and drew a graph to clarify the pattern, we successfully did it, yeah! 
    I like the interaction between programmer and user, I like every code that required user to input a value, it's like communicating to our computer. It feels like I'm no longer talking to a machine, but instead a live creature. A friendly one.
* Lab 8
    Part-1 is basically my favorite (not really actually, it took me long to figure out). We had to read the .txt inside our files, input the text inside, to see if the word is a palindrome or not. It could be an useful technique in the future, like searching for cerain keywords inside my txt file. (Who knows? If searching wors is avaliable, why not certain sentence?(Can't think of an example, sorry)).
